		<p>Aight we have 8 teams.  We'll be doing a 8 team double elimination to start this server off.  This tournament is gonna be done in one day hopefully.  If we need a second day then we'll do that.  I need your guys input though.  Do we want to do only one map?  Or for each round do we want another map?  Should grand finals be a best of 3 series?  What day would work best for you guys?</p>
		<p>lets get more people!  The more the merrier</p>
		<p>feel free to invite others! I want this to be a competitive, but fun thing.  So don't just bring super high level players in</p>
		<p>Just so the one who are here know!  We do have ultiduo pugs from time to time, so if you aren't sure about your partner try playing with them there!</p>
