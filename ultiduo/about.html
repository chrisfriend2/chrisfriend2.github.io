			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Something about this league...</p>
			<h2>Rules</h2>
			<p>To start off, Yes this is the extension of Friendly Neighborhood Pugs.  I started this because of how much I like to play ultiduo.</p>
			<p>Once you got your team situated I need you to go to #i-got-my-team and tell me who your partner is AND what you'd like your team name to be.  Be creative, but be respectful to people.</p>
			<p>Your match will be put in #here-is-your-matches-of-the-week .  It is up to each team to decide when to play their match.</p>
			<p>If you guys are unable to decide upon a day, contact an admin and they will do their best to help out.</p>
			<p>If one team cannot make a match on a given day then you can reschedule, but if it's a hassle contact an admin.</p>
			<p>A team can request that the enemy forfeits if one of the following conditions have been made: 
				<ol>
					<li>The other team hasn't made an serious effort at scheduling</li>
					<li>The other team has tried rescheduling 3 or more times in a given week</li>
					<li>The other team cheated</li>
					<li>The other team is refusing to change date</li>
				</ol>
				Admins will eventually get the last say, but we will review any and all of the evidence.
			</p>
			<p>When setting up your matches, post in #set-up-your-matches .  Keep it as uncluttered as possible.  This system will change after a while, but for now this is what we got.</p>
			<p>Once you guys have your match date set, One person from either team must post the date and the two teams who are facing each other in #match-dates </p>
			<p>If for some reason you can't make match date, then you can try to reschedule.  Contact an admin if this happens.</p>
			<p>You are also in charge of getting your own server.  na.serveme.tf is the server I use.  Use the proper ultiduo config.  tfcl_ultiduo_standard.</p>
			<p>Playoffs:  Playoffs will be played in a tournament bracket style.  Playoff matches will be posted in #bracket .</p>
			<p>You can also use our voice channels if you'd like.  You may use an external voice chat if you'd like.  Finals will be played using our voice channels.</p>
			<p>Now remember this is a place that I want toxicity to be non existent.  So if you have a problem with it contact one of the admins and we'll figure out what to do.</p>
